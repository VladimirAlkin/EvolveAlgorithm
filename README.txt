Evolving algorithm structure
Student project

From list of 100 random sentences we try to pursue the target sentence
We user random mutations in strings. They're will appear at any letter with given probability
After matching best similar sentence of generation - algorithm will make list of 100 similar sentences and will go on
Cycle continue till we reach 1000 generation or we get to target sentence
